## Project Overview
The triangular wave generator produces a continuous triangular waveform for a specified input using operational amplifiers. The design process includes:
<br>
- Creating a square wave generator.
- Using the output of the square wave to generate a triangular waveform.
- Simulating the circuit to verify the performance.

## Features
- Design of both square and triangular wave generators.
- Simulation of the circuit to validate functionality.
- Selection of resistors and capacitors to achieve desired waveform specifications.

## Requirements
- Basic knowledge of operational amplifiers.
- Circuit simulation software (such as LTspice or Multisim).
